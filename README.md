# Dynasty Chapter Comments

This userscript adds the capability to view forum posts corresponding to a chapter directly on the
chapter page. Click on the "Show Comments" button below the page view of a chapter to show.

Since Dynasty does not actually support posting on specific chapters of a series, forum posts are
associated with a chapter by comparing their timestamps. This means that posts discussing chapters
earlier than the current one may show up if they were made after the chapter was added. However,
posts discussing future chapters should never appear, except in rare cases where chapters are added
to Dynasty out of order.

Some caveats:

* Chapters that were added to Dynasty in a single batch will only have comments available on the
  last chapter in the batch.
* Only works for Series chapters; not supported for Anthologies.

## Changelog
* 0.1.0 initial release.
